Overview:
The Mental Fitness Tracker is a project designed to help individuals monitor and improve their mental well-being through data-driven insights. The primary goal of the tracker is to provide users with tools and analytics to better understand and manage their mental health. By collecting and analyzing data related to mood, stress levels, sleep quality, and other factors, the tracker aims to empower users to make informed decisions and adopt healthy lifestyle practices.

Data Preprocessing:
In the Data Preprocessing stage, non-numeric labels are transformed into numeric labels using the LabelEncoder from the scikit-learn library. This process involves iterating through each column in the dataset and checking if its data type is 'object'. If a column contains non-numeric labels, the LabelEncoder is applied to transform the labels into numeric representations. This preprocessing step ensures that the data can be used effectively for model training and analysis.

Model Training:
The process of model training involves several key steps:

Dataset Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Linear Regression Model: A Linear Regression model is chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. The model is instantiated using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.
Model Fitting: The training data is used to fit (train) the Linear Regression model. This involves finding the optimal coefficients that minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.
Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using various metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model fits the data and its predictive capabilities.
Results and Evaluation:
After training the Linear Regression model, several evaluation metrics are computed to assess its performance:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): This metric measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better model performance.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides a more interpretable measure of error.
R-squared score (R2): R2 score represents the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. A higher R2 score indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
Future Work:
While the current version of the Mental Fitness Tracker provides valuable insights into mental well-being, there are several enhancements and features that could be added to improve its functionality:

Integration with Wearable Devices: Incorporating data from wearable devices such as fitness trackers and smartwatches to provide real-time monitoring of physical activity and sleep patterns.
Personalized Recommendations: Implementing machine learning algorithms to generate personalized recommendations based on users' data and preferences.
Interactive Visualizations: Enhancing the user interface with interactive visualizations and dashboards to facilitate better understanding and interpretation of data.
Incorporation of Additional Data Sources: Integrating additional data sources such as social media activity, weather conditions, and daily routines to provide a more comprehensive view of users' mental health.
